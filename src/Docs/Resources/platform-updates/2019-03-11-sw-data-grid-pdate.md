[__RAW__]: <>(__RAW__)

<ul>
	<li>The prop &quot;identifier&quot; is no longer required. When no identifier is set the grid will not save any settings to the localStorage.</li>
	<li>The prop &quot;dataSource&quot; now also accepts Objects. (This is needed for the new data handling with &quot;repository&quot;)</li>
	<li>Columns do now have a resize limit and can not be resized smaller than 65 pixel.</li>
	<li>Accidental sorting when doing a column resize should now be fixed.</li>
</ul>
