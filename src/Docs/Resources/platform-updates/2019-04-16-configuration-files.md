[titleEn]: <>(Configuration files)

For the extraction of a production-ready community edition template, some configuration variables will be moved into the platform.
 
The routing configuration has already been moved into the bundles of the platform and they will be registered automatically. You can find the configuration file in the same folder structure like our plugins: `Resources/config/route.xml`
 
More configuration files will most likely follow in the near future.
