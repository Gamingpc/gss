<p>We changed the properties of <strong>src/Core/Checkout/Payment/PaymentMethodEntity.php</strong> from <strong>additionalDescription</strong> to <strong>description</strong> and <strong>surcharge_string</strong> to <strong>surcharge_text</strong>. <strong>surcharge_text</strong> is also now translateable.</p>
